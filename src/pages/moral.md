description: What is morality?

Morality (from Latin moralitas 'manner, character, proper behavior') is the differentiation of intentions, decisions and
actions between those that are distinguished as proper (right) and those that are improper (wrong). Morality can be a
body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it
can derive from a standard that a person believes should be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous
with "goodness" or "rightness".

Moral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and
normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and
consequentialism. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states: "One should treat others
as one would like others to treat oneself."

Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e. opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is
variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards
and/or principles.
